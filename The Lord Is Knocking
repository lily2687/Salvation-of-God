<div style="font-family: &quot;times new roman&quot;, times, serif; font-size: 19px; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0em;">The Church of Almighty God Variety Show | "The Lord Is Knocking" | Welcome the Return of the Lord

The skit The Lord Is Knocking explains how, in the last days, the Lord knocks at the door of our hearts with His words, and that wise virgins can hear God's voice and feast with the Lamb.

Pastor Chang Shoudao has always awaited the Lord's return, but when Brother Zhen testifies to him that the Lord has already returned, he stubbornly sticks to his own notions and imaginings, believing that the Lord will return on a cloud, and keeping the door of his heart closed to the true way. This time, however, Brother Zhen discusses passages of the Scripture relating to the Lord's return with him, and he discovers that the Bible contains prophecies that in the last days the Lord will return in secret, in incarnate flesh, to speak new words and purify man, and only afterward will appear publicly to reward good and punish evil. At the same time, he comes to understand the true meaning of the Lord knocking at our doors, and that the key to welcoming the Lord's return is being able to hear God's voice. When he finally hears the voice of God in Almighty God's word, he finally opens the door to his heart and welcomes the Lord's return.
